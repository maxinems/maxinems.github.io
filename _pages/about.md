Hi! I am Maxine and I am a data scientist currently working at [Arup](https://www.arup.com/) striving to embed AI and ML in the built environment. Recently, I graduated with my MSc in Social Data Science at [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. Here, I researched the spread of climate misinformation on Twitter using social network analysis. Prior to that, I studied IT and Business during my undergrad at University College London [(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia, and I moved to London in 2017. My general interest include network analysis, computational social science, and climate change. I am passionate about applying digital technologies and big data to tackle societal problems from waste, climate change, and sustainability. 

If you also work in Data, want to share some thoughts, or have a chat, feel free to reach out!

Maxine

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
